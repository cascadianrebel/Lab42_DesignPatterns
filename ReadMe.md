# Lab42 Design Patterns

## Specs

- Console Application created within Visual Studio 2017
- Documents are types that make up a Resume or Report. 
- Documents consist of different Pages (Cover letter, References, Work History, Summary Page, etc)

### Factory Method Design Pattern
1. Product - Pages
2. Concrete Product -  "References", "Work History", "Summary Page", "Personal Statement"
3. Creator -  Document
4. Concrete Creator - "Resume"
